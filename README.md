*Description

Maze Generator collects and canonicalizes the input from the user for maze generation. When generating a maze, the user should specify the size, bias, algorithm, characters used to represent the walls of the maze in the output, as well as where to send the output (stdout or print to a file).
In this project we have used Recursive Backtracking, Sidewinder and Kruskal algorithm We have also included the ability to solve a maze provided by the user as input. In this case, instead of providing console arguments, the user pipes a maze in on stdin or specifies a file path in the first argument. This maze solution will come in the form of a set of '.' marking the path form entrance to exit.
